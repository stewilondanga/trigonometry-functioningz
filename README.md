Trigonometric Functions are Finally Here
This is a simple website built with HTML and CSS to showcase some of the basic trigonometric functions. The website is designed to provide an intuitive and 
interactive way to learn about trigonometric functions.

Features
Interactive display of basic trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent).
Clear and concise explanations of each function.
Graphical representations of each function to aid understanding.
User-friendly interface.

Getting Started
To get started, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. All the necessary HTML and CSS files are included in the repository, so you don't need to 
install any additional software.

Usage
Once you have opened the website in your web browser, you will see the main page. From there, you can see graphical animation of the basic trigonometric functions 
(sine, cosine, or tangent) to learn more about them. Each function has its own graphical representation of the function and a clear animation
of what the function does.
